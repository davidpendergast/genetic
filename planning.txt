Pool of Blood

Darkest Dungeon meets Super Auto Balls


Gameplay loop:

1. Choose level from branching map.
  - Different types of levels (different enemies, different encounters, bosses, reward nodes)
  - Levels may have optional bonus objectives, granting extra rewards.
    - e.g. Kill X Units with a ring-out
    - Win without falling below 1/2 HP on any units
2. Take out enemies using tactics, and/or complete bonus objectives.
3. Upon winning, get a set of rewards to choose from.
  - Must be applied to units immediately or discarded (no inventory).
4. Repeat


Concept:
 - Enemies and units behave like pool balls, dealing damage by hitting each other & obstacles.
 - Many effects, buffs and debuffs can be applied which change the ways units behave.
 - You control a team of heros, who can die (and death is relatively permanent).
 - New heros can be found during the run.
   - Are there classes or affinities for heros?
   - I think no, it's all buffs / debuffs
 - Are there different attack types? 
   - I think also no, each unit kind of does one attack with effects from buffs
  
 
Units have basic stats, some of which depend on the unit's speed:
 - DMG/HP/SPEED
   - (DMG is halfed of quartered at mid & low speed, respectively)
  - SPEED determines shot order, not movement speed
 - POWER (controls actual shot speed, which affects base damage)  
 - HEAL % Effectiveness
 - RADIUS
 - POISON %
 - DEBUFF RESIST
 - STATUS RESIST
 - MISCUE % (chance to perform a "miscue shot") 
 - ACCURACY (how badly miscues affect the shot)  ^ potentially combinable 
 - VISION (length of shot guidelines)
 - CRIT CHANCE
 - CRIT MULTI
 - CRIT RESIST
 - THORNS  (deal damage when touched)
  
  
AI:
  - enemy units choose their shots using Ghast's Special AlgorithmTM
    - (genetic algorithm)
    - different fitness functions for different units
    - needs to be FAST to compute (like instant)
    - fixed number of generations / population size per shot
      - maybe smarter enemies will get more search juice
      - should not be better on faster computers (lol)

Builds:
 - Offensive Paradigms:
   - POWER build that focuses on ring-outs
   - DMG build that focuses on direct damage
   - STATUS build that kills with status effects
   - SUMMON build that uses disposable units to kill enemies
 
 - Defensive Paradigms:
   - Control build that weakens & debuffs enemies
   - Armor/healing build that resists direct damage
   - Tactical build that uses movement and positioning to avoid damage
   - Status build that uses self-buffs to resist damage
  
 - Utility Paradigms:
   - Loot finding
   - Start of battle effects/debuffs on enemies
   - Scouting/map traversal buffs
   - Stuff that modifies level challenges
 
 
Thoughts:
 - Ok, so clearly there's a ton of potential for complexity here. 
 - Stats should aim to interact with physicsy stuff, not just raw numbers if possible
 - Direct Damage is boring if it's too effective.
   - Maybe some enemies should be unkillable via direct damage alone?
     - i.e. you have to ring-out them? Or even all enemies could work this way.
     - or have something like armor be the counter to direct damage
 - How to make player units resist unfair deaths?
   - DD's 0-hp last stand thing is pretty cool but I don't really wanna copy that.
   - Maybe units shouldn't perma-die individually in levels 
     - (just become inactive for the rest of the battle instead).
     - this also opens the door to self-sacrificing units and positive on-death effects
     - and revive mechanics?
